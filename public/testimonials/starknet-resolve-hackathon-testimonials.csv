Midatopay,"Participating in the hackathon was an incredible experience — it allowed us to validate a real idea, learn a lot in a short amount of time, and connect with top-tier builders. Winning was a huge boost for the project; it gave us visibility and confidence to keep building and scaling what we started there.

Best of luck with this new edition, and thanks for thinking of us!"
ChipiPay,"I'd encourage anyone, regardless of background, to challenge themselves and participate in a hackathon. You nurture your competitive spirit, spend time with some of the best developers in the world, and most importantly, learn to build fast, talk to early users, and solve real-life problems while competing for prizes. Take the chance. Fortune favors the bold."
Starkflow,"I was drawn to Starknet's sub-second finality and how rapidly the ecosystem was evolving—it felt like the right time to build something meaningful. What really stood out was the native mobile SDK support and the fact that scaling isn't bolted on as an afterthought, it's built into the architecture from day one.
Adaptation of web3 is possible only if mobile users are exposed to web3, Starknet proves to be one of the leading blockchains who provide mobile SDK's.
In simple words Starknet shows what's possible when you're building on infrastructure designed for real-world performance and end user SDK's."
zkbadge,"In order to expand my knowledge of safe and scalable blockchain systems, I participated in the StarkNet hackathon. The event greatly expanded my grasp of StarkNet's architecture and tooling. The influence of developing workable solutions on developing infrastructure was reinforced by winning, which was extremely satisfying. I'm glad to motivate other builders. Warm regards David"
Troves.fi AI,"I joined the Starknet hackathon to experiment and push my limits, but I left with way more than I expected, real learning, great feedback, and an amazing builder community. Winning felt surreal — like, “wait… my idea actually worked?” Also, sleep is optional during hackathons"
